## Fine print

Deploying Ghost to Heroku isn’t officially supported, but it’s definitely possible with just a little bit of tweaking. This repository just makes the necessary changes and makes a deploy button available. If you have problems using your instance of Ghost, you should check the [official documentation](http://support.ghost.org/).

**Note:** Image uploads are disabled, since Heroku app filesystems aren’t meant for permanent storage.
